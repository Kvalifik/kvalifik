# Kvalifik dk static site

Kvalifik's new website built with Gatsby and Dato CMS!

## How to develop

We use **npm** for all development. Make sure you have the Gatsby development tool installed [gatsby-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-cli).

`npm install`

Then

`npm run start`

Navigate to http://localhost:8000

Refer to Gatsby's own docs for more information about the endless universe of Gatsby!

## Stack

We use an implementation of the JAMStack with Gatsby for rendering the front end and DatoCMS providing the content. The website will probably be served by a CDN (Netlify or similar...)
